# What is Gemini?

Gemini is a **functional hardware description language** created by Aditya Srinivasan and Dr. Drew Hilton from Duke University.

Let's break this down:

> _"functional"_

Gemini was influenced heavily by the functional paradigm and borrows many features and syntax from popular functional programming languages such as SML and OCaml.

> _"hardware description language"_

Although Gemini is similar in appearance to a high-level software programming language, programs are transformed by the Gemini compiler into modules in Verilog, a popular contemporary hardware description language, which can then be verified, simulated, and synthesized.

Gemini boasts many features that enable a high degree of expressivity and modularity, such as:
* type inference
* parametric polymorphism
* recursion
* higher-order functions
* recursive datatypes
* module system
* pattern matching
